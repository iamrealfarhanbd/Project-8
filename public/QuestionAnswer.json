      "question":"Difference between props &  state?",
      "answer":"In react there are important two data manipulation methods. One is props and the other is a state. A state can be initialized with the help of props. With the help of Props, we can make components reusable. But when we look into the state it doesn't do the same. It cannot make components reusable. Props are immutable and the state is mutable."
